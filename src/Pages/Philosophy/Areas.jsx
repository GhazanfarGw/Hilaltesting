                            The educational technology (edtech)
                            sector has seen unprecedented growth in
                            recent years, particularly accelerated by
                            the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on
                            learning modalities. In fact according to
                            our research global edtech funding has
                            reached record levels after the pandemic
                            illustrating the growing investor confidence
                            in the sector.

                            The last several years have seen dynamic
                            growth with increased investment in digital
                            infrastructure and a shift toward remote
                            learning. This transition has necessitated reevaluating traditional educational models
                            and spurred innovation.

                            The pandemic highlighted the necessity
                            of digital solutions in education, leading
                            to a “new normal” where hybrid learning
                            environments have become more
                            common. This significant shift suggests that
                            technology integration in education is now
                            a long-term trend rather than a temporary
                            solution.

                            The pandemic accelerated educators’
                            familiarity with edtech tools and curriculum,
                            and the new wave of AI has enabled
                            teachers and students to access use-cases
                            that are different from the norm and in new
                            sectors which makes them more effective.
